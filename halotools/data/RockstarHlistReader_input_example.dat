# This file is an example of how to use the ``columns_to_keep_ascii_fname`` 
# feature of the RockstarHlistReader. 
# The present file can have any number of header lines beginning with the '#' character, 
# all of which will be ignored by the RockstarHlistReader, 
# but which may be useful for your own private bookkeeping, e.g., 
# ``columns_to_keep_ascii_fname`` used to process ``some_hlist_file`` on 28 July, 2015. 
#
# The number of rows of data below determine the number of halo properties 
# that will be extracted from a Rockstar hlist file. 
#
# Column 1: the column index of the hlist file storing the desired data, 
# beginning with 0 for the first column of data in the halo catalog ASCII file. 
#
# Column 2: the name that will be given to the halo property stored in the desired column. 
#
# Column 3: the type of data stored in the column, 
# e.g., 'f4' for a float, 'f8' for a double, 'i8' for a long. 
#
# Halotools convention is to have all halo properties begin with `halo_`. 
# This will be necessary if you want to store the halo catalog in the Halotools cache 
# and use it to populate mock catalogs with Halotools. 
# But if you are processing a Rockstar hlist file for other purposes, 
# you can safely ignore this convention. 
#
# In the example provided here, we will compose our entries so that 
# the RockstarHlistReader class will extract eight halo properties from 
# a hypothetical Rockstar hlist file. 
# 
0  halo_scale_factor  'f4'
