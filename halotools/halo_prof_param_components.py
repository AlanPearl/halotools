halotools.halo_prof_param_components contains the classes and functions 
defining relations between dark matter halos and the parameters 
governing their internal structure. The classic example of such a component 
is a relation between halo mass and NFW concentration. More generally, 
a halo profile parameter model is just a mapping between *any* 
halo property and *any* profile parameter.
