# Rotations

This package contains functions to rotate collections of 2D and 3D vectors.

Some of the functionality of this package is taken from the [Halotools](https://halotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) utilities sudmodule, and reproduced here for convenience.    


## Description

This package contains tools to perform:

* rotations of 3D vectors,
* rotations of 2D vectors,
* and monte carlo rotations of 2D and 3D vectors.


## Requirements

In order to use the functions in this package, you will need the following python packages installed:

* numpy
* astropy


## Installation

Place this directory in your PYTHONPATH.  The various functions can then be imported as, e.g.:  

```
from rotations.rotations3d import rotate_vector_collection
```
