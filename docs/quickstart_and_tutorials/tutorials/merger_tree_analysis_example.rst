Calculating the Sum of Halo Progenitor Masses
**************************************************************

This section of the documentation describes how to use the `crossmatch`
and `group_member_generator` utility functions to analyze subhalo merger trees.
Many more complicated analyses of merger trees can be built upon by
matching the basic patterns shown here, which speed up naive algorithms by
several orders of magnitude.
