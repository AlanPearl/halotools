Tutorial on analyzing galaxy catalogs 
**********************************************************************

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to use Halotools to 
analyze a mock galaxy catalog. We will proceed by giving a series of 
increasingly complex examples. Each example is in principle stand-alone, 
so that you can pick and choose from any of the pages below according to 
the kind of analysis you are most interested in. 
In cases where material covered in a previous example is necessary 
to understand some aspect of one of the more complicated later calculations, 
a link to the previous example will always be provided.
