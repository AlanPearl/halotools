Tutorial on Conditional Abundance Matching
**********************************************************************

Conditional Abundance Matching (CAM) is a technique that you can use to
model galaxy properties with simultaneous dependence upon two halo properties.
This tutorial introduces the CAM technique and gives a few worked examples
of how it can be applied to help build models of the galaxy-halo connection.
