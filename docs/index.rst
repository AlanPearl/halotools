Welcome to the halotools documentation. 
The package is still under rapid development, with its basic API being restructured 
frequently. In short, it is still not "stable". Do not even use at your own risk 
in its current form.

Presently, only the basic API is documented. This will change once the baseline 
mock-making modules are set in place.
