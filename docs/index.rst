Welcome to the halotools documentation. Halotools is a python package 
designed to study large scale structure, cosmology, and galaxy evolution 
using N-body simulations and halo models. The code is publicly available 
at https://github.com/aphearin/halotools.git.

The package is still under rapid development, with its API being restructured 
frequently. In short, it is still not "stable". In particular, 
if you download the code and write 
scripts based on the current API, your scripts will likely not 
correctly interface with future versions of the code.

Presently, only the basic API is documented. This will change once more of 
the core functionality is in place.
