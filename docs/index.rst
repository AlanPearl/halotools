Welcome to the halotools documentation. Halotools is a python package 
designed to study large scale structure, cosmology, and galaxy evolution 
using N-body simulations and halo models. The code is publicly available 
at https://github.com/aphearin/halotools.git.

The package is still under rapid development, with its API being restructured 
frequently. In short, it is still not "stable". Do not even use at your own risk 
in its current form.

Presently, only the basic API is documented. This will change once more of 
the core functionality is in place.
